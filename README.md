Assignment: Grade Calculator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator
Hey there!

Welcome to this repository featuring three programs: a Grade Calculator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator. 

Grade Calculator
This  tool lets you input your marks and tells you the grade you've earned. Just enter your marks between 0 and 100.You'll get your grade displayed right on the screen.

Setup
You'll find HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files here. The HTML file has a button and an input field for you to interact with. The CSS file adds some style, and the JavaScript file has the magic. It contains a function called calculateGrade() that runs when you click the button. This function figures out your grade based on your input and displays it on the page.

Speed Detector
Just enter your car's speed, and it'll let you know if you're within the legal limit. If you're speeding, it'll even calculate how many demerit points you've earned.

Setup
Just like the Grade Calculator, we've kept things simple. You'll see HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Click the button after entering your speed, and watch the magic happen. The JavaScript function speedLimitChecker() does all the heavy lifting, and the result pops up on the screen.

Net Salary Calculator
Curious about how much you'll take home from your job? This calculator has you covered. Enter your basic salary and benefits, and it'll calculate deductions like taxes and insurance to give you your net salary.

Setup
No need to stress about complicated setups. It's the same drill here: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Just fill in your details, hit the button, and see your net salary appear like magic. The JavaScript function startSalaryCalculator() does all the math for you.
